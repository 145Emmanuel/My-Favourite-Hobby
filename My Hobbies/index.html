            My favourite hobbies are reading and athletics. Reading helps me pass tim when I'm bored and also helps me learn new vocabulary. It helps me to forget everything around me for a moment. My Athletic sport is Running, I love running as it helps keep my body in shape and helps me have high stamina.
